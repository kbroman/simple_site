My background is in business analysis. I've spent most of my time in the hospitality industry as well as the manufacturing industry. My tech stack consists of SQL and [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [Fivetran](https://fivetran.com/), [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) and [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), and a variety of BI visualization tools, such as [Looker](https://cloud.google.com/looker), [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), and [MicroStrategy](https://www.microstrategy.com/). 

My education is in Economics. I am working to obtain a MS Economics degree from Purdue University, building on my BS Economics degree from UT Dallas.
